# Dark Universes Within the Void

### A Conceptual Multiverse-Topology and Information-Isolation Theory Study

## Conceptual Explanation

This study explores the idea that **not all universes necessarily generate or propagate light**. Some may evolve in complete electromagnetic silence inside isolated void-topology zones.

The paper investigates:

* Universes that may be **photon-null but gravitationally active**
* The idea that **light is not a guaranteed emergent vibration mode**
* The possibility of **information-only causal propagation**
* Why dark universes may be more statistically common than luminous ones
* How universes embedded inside a meta-void may evolve under different stability constraints
* Why information coherence becomes the only “observable” physics inside photon-silent domains
* Why gravity may be the only cross-void memory-retaining interaction
* Why isolated universes may collapse faster due to **entropy buildup without radiation export**
* Why our universe may be a rare stable vibration branch that happened to allow photons
