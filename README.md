## 🌌 Theory Summary (Narrative Form)

This work challenges the hidden assumption that **light must exist in all universes**.

The paper argues conceptually that:

* **Photon emergence is not a mandatory vibration mode**
* Some universes may evolve in **complete electromagnetic silence**
* In such universes:

  * No stars ever shine
  * No photons ever propagate
  * No telescopes ever get signals
  * No observers ever evolve through EM feedback
* These universes are **dark not by choice, but by vibrational suppression bias**
* **Information becomes the only causal messenger**
* **Gravity becomes the only memory-retaining inheritance link**
* Entropy builds internally because **radiation export is impossible**
* Collapse happens faster because **energy cannot leak outward**
* Our universe is framed as a **rare luminous survivor branch**, not the default cosmology
* The multiverse is modeled conceptually as a **foam of causally isolated information bubbles inside meta-void topology**
* Isolation is not emptiness, but **lack of vibrational coupling**
* Anthropic selection still exists, but driven by **information stability, not electromagnetic feedback**
* The silent universes vastly outnumber luminous ones conceptually
* The visible universe is not typical—it is an anomaly that survived long enough to observe itself

## Repository Purpose

* Archive of photon-null multiverse theory
* Authorship protection
* Future falsifiable prediction expansion base

---

## Ethics Positioning

* No real-world field guidance
* No harmful translation
* Academic cosmology only
